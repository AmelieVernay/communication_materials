\begin{frame}{Benchmarking algorithms in practice}

Choosing the best algorithm to solve an optimization problem often depends on:\\[1em]

\begin{minipage}{.8\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The data \mybold{scale, conditionning}
	\item The objective parameters \mybold{regularisation}
	\item The implementation \mybold{complexity, language}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

\vskip2em
An impartial selection requires a time consuming {\bf benchmark}!\\[1em]


The goal of {\bf \texttt{benchopt}} is to make this step as easy as possible.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\texttt{benchopt}}

Doing a  benchmark for the $\ell_2$ regularized logistic regression with multiple solvers and datasets is now easy as calling:\\[1em]

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
git clone https://github.com/benchopt/benchmark_logreg_l2
benchopt run ./benchmark_logreg_l2
\end{lstlisting}

\vskip1.5em
\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{logreg_l2}

\begin{frame}{\texttt{benchopt}}

\texttt{benchopt} can also compare the same algo in different languages.\\[1em]

Here is an example comparing PGD in: Python; R; Julia.\\[1em]

\begin{frame}{Benchmark: principle}

A benchmark is a directory with:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item An \lstinline+objective.py+ file with an \lstinline+Objective+
    \item A directory \lstinline+solvers+ with one file per \lstinline+Solver+
    \item A directory \lstinline+datasets+ with \lstinline+Dataset+ generators/fetchers
\end{itemize}
\vskip1em

\rem each objects above can be parametrized

\vskip1em

The \lstinline+benchopt+ client runs a cross product and generates a csv file + convergence plots like above.\\[.5em]
We expose easy way to select the \lstinline+objective/solver/dataset+ you want to run.

\begin{frame}{Status}

Currently, benchmarks implementation available for:\\[.5em]
\begin{itemize}
	\item Least Square
	\item Non-Negative Least Square
	\item Lasso
	\item L1/L2 Regularized Logistic Regression
\end{itemize}

% \vskip1em
% Help appreciated: feel free to \underline{join} our effort to create reproducible benchmarks by adding new objectives/solvers/datasets!!!\\[1em]
