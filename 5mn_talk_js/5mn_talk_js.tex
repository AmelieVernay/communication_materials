\begin{frame}{Benchmarking algorithms in practice}

Choosing the best algorithm to solve an optimization problem often depends on:\\[1em]

\begin{minipage}{.8\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The data \mybold{scale, conditionning}
	\item The objective parameters \mybold{regularisation}
	\item The implementation \mybold{complexity, language}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

\vskip2em
An impartial selection requires a time consuming {\bf benchmark}!\\[1em]


The goal of {\bf Benchopt} is to make this step as easy as possible.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Benchopt}

Doing a  benchmark for the $\ell_2$ regularized logistic regression with multiple solvers and datasets is now easy as calling:\\[1em]

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]

\begin{frame}{Benchopt}

Benchopt can also compare the same algo in different languages.\\[1em]

Here is an example comparing PGD in: Python; R; Julia.\\[1em]

\begin{frame}{Benchmark: principle}

A benchmark is a directory with:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item An \lstinline+objective.py+ file with an \lstinline+Objective+,
    \item A directory \lstinline+solvers+ with one file per \lstinline+Solver+,
    \item A directory \lstinline+datasets+ with \lstinline+Dataset+ generators/fetchers.
\end{itemize}
\vskip1em
Each of these objects can be parametrized.\\

The \lstinline+benchopt+ client runs a cross product and generates a csv file + convergence plots like above.\\[.5em]
We expose easy way to select the \lstinline+objective/solver/dataset+ you want to run.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Benchmarks}

So far, we have implemented benchmarks for:\\[.5em]
\begin{itemize}
	\item Least Square
	\item Non-Negative Least Square
	\item Lasso
	\item L1/L2 Regularized Logistic Regression
\end{itemize}

\vskip1em
Feel free to join our effort to create reproducible benchmarks by adding new objectives/solvers/datasets!!!\\[1em]
